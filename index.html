            Cookie Monster is a blue Muppet character on the long-running PBS/HBO children's television show Sesame Street. In a song in 2004,
            and later in an interview in 2017, Cookie Monster revealed that his real name is "Sid". He is best known for his voracious appetite
            and his famous eating catchphrases, such as "Me want cookie!" Although he eats almost anything, including normally inedible
            objects, as his name suggests, his preferred food is cookies. Chocolate chip cookies are his favorite kind. "Me" is the only way
            Cookie Monster refers to himself, as he stays away from using "I","My", and "Mine" like normal people do when referring to themselves.
            Despite his voracious appetite for cookies, Cookie Monster shows awareness of healthy eating habits for young children and also
            enjoys fruits and eggplant. He is known to have a mother, a younger sister, and an identically-designed cousin (who does not like
            cookies). All three share his characteristic blue fur and "googly eyes". He also has a father, who appeared in a Monsterpiece Theater
            sketch promoting energy conservation, water conservation and environmentalism. Cookie Monster's mother and father both share his
            enormous appetite and craving for cookies.
